# FlavorFrames API

## Code Institute Portfolio Project 5

Welcome to the backend of FlavorFrames, a platform designed for food enthusiasts to share and discover popular eateries and hidden gems. You can find detailed information on the frontend implementation [here](https://github.com/Maximiliane-K/flavorframes).

In an era where food crawls, mukbangs, and street food adventures are widely shared, FlavorFrames makes it easy for users to showcase their favorite finds. Whether it’s a hidden café, a must-visit food stall, or a trending restaurant, the platform helps users connect through their culinary discoveries.

FlavorFrames focuses exclusively on food and drinks, making it easier to find trending spots in your city or while traveling.

The FlavorFrames API powers the platform by providing essential functionalities that allow users to share and engage with food content. 
Users can create, update, and delete posts that include images, written descriptions, and location tags. They can follow other users, like and comment on posts, and engage with the community. Additionally, users can create, update, and delete events, which feature images, descriptions, event dates, and categorized event types. Users also have the option to mark themselves as attending an event if they are interested.

To enhance the experience, the API also includes search and filtering capabilities, making it easier to discover posts that match individual tastes and interests.

You can view the live API [here](https://flavorframes-drf-api-571215953f7d.herokuapp.com/).

## Structure Plane


### **Features**

### Homepage
When entering the API site, you are directed to the Root Route homepage, with a message welcoming you to the API:

![Homepage](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740864518/Screenshot_2025-03-01_at_22.27.34_ifo6na.png)


### Profile Data

Users can view a list of all profiles available in the API within the Profile List section.

![Profiles list](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740865325/Screenshot_2025-03-01_at_22.41.55_d5qqt4.png)

Profile creation is not manually enabled, as it is handled automatically through the user registration process.

The Profile List section allows users to view all profiles available in the API.

The Profile model includes fields such as:

- owner
- created_at
- updated_at
- screenname
- city
- about
- profile_picture
  
Additionally, the ProfileSerializer enhances the JSON response with the following fields:

- is_owner 
- following_id 
- posts_count 
- events_count 
- followers_count
- following_count

Users can filter profiles in two ways:

- Profiles that are following the logged-in user.
- Profiles that are being followed by the logged-in user.
  
Profiles can also be sorted using:

- posts_count
- events_count
- followers_count
- following_count
- owner__user_follows__followed_at
- owner__user_followed_by__followed_at

Editing and Deleting Profiles

- Users cannot create a profile manually, as it is tied to their account.
  
If a user visits their own profile, they gain access to:

- A pre-filled form to edit profile details (city, about, profile_picture).
- A delete button to permanently remove their profile.


### Post Data 

Users can view a list of all posts available in the API within the Posts List section.

![Posts list](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740866393/Screenshot_2025-03-01_at_22.59.41_ypyv89.png)

Each post includes an image, written content, and an optional Google Maps location link to highlight a specific place (e.g., a restaurant or cafe).

Posts are displayed in descending order based on their creation date.

In addition to the fields in the Post model, the PostSerializer enriches the JSON response with:

- is_owner 
- profile_image 
- like_id 
- likes_count 
- comments_count 

The ordering options for posts include:

- likes_count
- comments_count
- likes_created_at
  
The API also supports searching and filtering:

- Posts by followed users 
- Liked posts
- User’s own posts
  
If a user is logged in, they can create a new post that will appear in the posts list.

When a user views a post they own, additional edit and delete options become available:

- A pre-filled edit form allows the user to update the post details.
- A delete button allows them to remove the post permanently from the API.


### Events & Attendance Data 

Users can view a list of all events available in the API within the Events List section.

![Events & Attendance Data](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740867087/Screenshot_2025-03-01_at_23.11.18_tuaydl.png)

Besides the fields defined in the Event model (as shown in the ERD Diagram), additional fields have been added through the serializer to enhance the JSON response:

- is_owner
- profile_image
- user_status (indicates if the current user is attending or interested in the event)

The Events List allows filtering and ordering of events based on the following parameters:

- event_date (chronological order)
- category (filtering events by type)
- created_at (most recent events first)
  
Filtering Options:

- Events created by users the logged-in user follows ('Event Feed' page).
- Events the logged-in user has marked as attending ('My Events' page).
- Events created by a specific user (profile page).
  
If a user is logged in, they can create new events by submitting a form.

Additionally, if a user views an event they created, they gain access to Edit and Delete functionalities, allowing them to update or remove the event from the API.

#### Event Attendance:

Users have the option to mark themselves as attending or interested in an event. 
This functionality is managed through the Event Attendance model, which records each user's status for a given event.

Through the EventAttendanceSerializer, the following data is included in the JSON response:

- user
- profile_image
- event
- status (whether the user is "attending")
  
Attendance Features:
- A user can mark themselves as attending an event.
- A user can revoke their attendance by clicking the button again.
- A list of attendees for an event is displayed so users can see who is going.
  
Attendance records are unique per user and event to ensure accuracy.


### Comments Data
Users can view all comments available in the API within the Comments List section.

![Comment Data](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740867817/Screenshot_2025-03-01_at_23.23.27_riscsq.png)

Besides the fields defined in the Comment model (as shown in the ERD Diagram), additional fields have been added through the serializer to enhance the JSON response:

- is_owner
- profile_id
- profile_image
- created_at and updated_at
  
To improve data accessibility, comments can be filtered by the post they are associated with, 
allowing users to see all comments related to a specific post. 

Additionally, comments are ordered by creation date, with the most recent appearing first.

Commenting Features:

- Logged-in users can create a new comment by selecting the post they wish to comment on and entering text.
- Users can edit or delete their own comments from the API.
- A pre-populated form is available when editing a comment.
- A delete button allows users to remove their own comments.
  
This setup ensures that users can actively engage with posts through commenting while maintaining control over their contributions.


### Likes Data 

Users can view a list of all likes within the Likes List section.

Each like is associated with a user and a post, ensuring that users can engage with content by liking posts.

Like Functionality:
- Logged-in users can like a post by selecting it.
- Users cannot like the same post twice—an error message is displayed if they attempt to do so.
- Users cannot like their own posts — attempting to do so will also result in an error.
- Likes are ordered by timestamp, with the most recent likes appearing first.

Deleting Likes:
- Once logged in, users can remove their own likes by interacting with the same post.
- If a user tries to delete a like that does not belong to them, the action is not permitted.
  
This setup ensures that users can interact with posts while preventing duplicate or self-likes, maintaining a fair engagement system.


### Followers Data

Within the Followers List section, users can view a list of all follow relationships in the API.

![Followers data](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740871262/Screenshot_2025-03-02_at_00.20.53_v0ayfb.png)

If a user is logged in, they can follow another user by selecting their profile. 
This action creates a follow relationship, allowing them to see updates from that profile.

To prevent duplicate relationships, the system ensures that a user cannot follow the same profile more than once. 

If a user attempts to follow someone they are already following, they receive an error message informing them that the follow action is not possible. 

Similarly, a user cannot follow themselves.

Users can also unfollow profiles they are following. However, editing a follow relationship is not possible — users can only create or delete follows.

## Skeleton Plane

#### **Database Shema**

**Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

The relationships between the models are visualized in the following Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

![Entity relationship diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/maxiscloud/image/upload/v1740873448/Screenshot_2025-03-02_at_00.52.03_ekbvhd.png)

I have structured the database for FlavorFrames API with the following models:

- Users (Managed by Django’s built-in authentication system)
- Profiles (Automatically created upon user registration)
- Posts (Users can create and share posts with descriptions and location links)
- Likes (Users can like posts)
- Comments (Users can comment on posts)
- Events (Users can create and manage food-related events)
- Event Attendance (Users can mark themselves as attending in an event)
- Followers (Users can follow other users)
  
Notes on the ER Diagram:

- The Users table is not explicitly declared in the models but is managed by Django's authentication system.
- The Profiles table is linked one-to-one with Users and stores additional profile information.
- The Event Attendance model connects users with events, allowing them to mark their attendance.
  
The relationships illustrated reflect the logical structure of the database, not necessarily all physical constraints.
