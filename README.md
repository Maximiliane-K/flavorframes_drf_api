# FlavorFrames API

## Code Institute Portfolio Project 5

Welcome to the backend of FlavorFrames, a platform designed for food enthusiasts to share and discover popular eateries and hidden gems. You can find detailed information on the frontend implementation [here](https://github.com/Maximiliane-K/flavorframes).

In an era where food crawls, mukbangs, and street food adventures are widely shared, FlavorFrames makes it easy for users to showcase their favorite finds. Whether it’s a hidden café, a must-visit food stall, or a trending restaurant, the platform helps users connect through their culinary discoveries.

FlavorFrames focuses exclusively on food and drinks, making it easier to find trending spots in your city or while traveling.

The FlavorFrames API powers the platform by providing essential functionalities that allow users to share and engage with food content. 
Users can create, update, and delete posts featuring images, written descriptions, and location tags. They can follow others, interact through likes and comments. 

To enhance the experience, the API also includes search and filtering capabilities, making it easier to discover posts that match individual tastes and interests.
